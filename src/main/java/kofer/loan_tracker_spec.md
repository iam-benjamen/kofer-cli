### üõ†Ô∏è SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW

#### 1. TransactionManager

- Handles all generic transactions
- Methods:
  - `addTransaction(type, amount, category, description?, date?)`
  - `getTransactions(filter?)`
  - `summarize(month?, year?)`
  - `exportToCSV()`
- Repayments from loans are added here with `type = loan_repayment`

#### 2. LoanManager

- Tracks loans and repayments
- Methods:
  - `addLoan(lender, amount, description?)`
  - `repayLoan(lender, amount, note?)`
  - `viewLoan(lender)`
  - `listLoans()`
  - `closeLoan(lender)`
- Also adds a loan repayment transaction via `TransactionManager`

#### 3. DataStore

- Reads/writes to local encrypted JSON file
- Loads data into memory on app start
- Uses passphrase for encryption/decryption

#### 4. CLI

- Handles user interaction
- Routes commands to the appropriate modules
- Provides usage hints and help

#### 5. EncryptionService

- Uses AES encryption
- Derives key from user-supplied passphrase
- Encrypts/decrypts data before storage or after loading

#### 6. Models

- `Transaction`
- `Loan`
- `Repayment`

### üß∞ SAMPLE COMMANDS

```bash
loan add michael 50000 "Borrowed for house rent"

All loan repayments will also show up in transaction summaries categorized by lender name.
